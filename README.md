BT Utility Plugin
-------------
An extension to the UE4 behavior tree adding support for utility-based selection.

This is a stripped down version of an in-progress engine mod (https://github.com/kamrann/UnrealEngine) which omits some editor modifications, but maintains the core functionality as a plugin which can work with a regular engine installation.

NOTES
-------------
Custom blueprint based utility functions do not currently expose the usual decorator events such as activation/tick. This will be fixed eventually.
